  title: WeNet - Interaction protocol engine API
  description: >-
		This API will be used to storing and maintaining the task description,
		and the community description, along with their associated norms, to realize the user
		interactions between them sending messages guaranteeing that they follow the norms,
		and to form teams to realize a task.
		
		The functionality of the API is organized around the following concepts:
		
		 * **Community**: is a group of users with a common goal.
		 * **Message**: is the atomic communication between users.
		 * **Norm**: is a rule that restricts or prescribes the behaviour of users.
		 * **Profile**: is a fixed set of user attributes.
		 * **Task**: is an individual goal to be achieved by a team.
		 * **Team**: is a group of individuals set to fulfil a task.
		 * **Trust**: is the confidence that another user achieve a task.
		
		
		## Community
		
		The functionality provided allows to managing members, norms and task types associated with a community.
		
		At the moment does not exist any restriction to create communities.
		Every member of a community has the right to access to:
		
		 * The name, description and avatar of the community.
		 * The task types that can be done in the community.
		 * The norm of the community.
		 * The list of members of the community.
		 * The list of task instances that it is involved.
		
		For the rest of the actions it needs to have the privilege to perform the action. This privileges can be:
		
		 * **MODIFY_NAME**: a user with this privilege can modify the name of the community.
		 * **MODIFY_DESCRIPTION**: a user with this privilege can modify the description of the community.
		 * **MODIFY_KEYWORDS**: a user with this privilege can modify the keywords of the community.
		 * **MODIFY_AVATAR**: a user with this privilege can modify the avatar image of the community.
		 * **ADD_NORM**: a user with this privilege can add a new norm into the community.
		 * **REMOVE_NORM**: a user with this privilege can remove a norm form the community.
		 * **ADD_MEMBER**: a user with this privilege can add a new user into the community.
		 * **REMOVE_MEMBER**: a user with this privilege can remove a user from the community.
		 * **MODIFY_MEMBER_PRIVILEGES**: a user with this privilege can modify the privileges of a community member.
		 * **VIEW_MEMBER_PRIVILEGES**: a user with this privilege can view the privileges of a community member.
		 * **ADD_TASK_TYPE**: a user with this privilege can add a new type of task that can be done in the community.
		 * **REMOVE_TASK_TYPE**: a user with this privilege can remove a type of task that can be done in the community.
		 * **ADD_TASK_INSTANCE**: a user with this privilege can start a new task to do in a community.
		
		
		On the other hand, to join into a community you have to do the same action to add a member,
		and to leave a community the same action as remove a member.
		
		
		## Message
		
		The functionality provided allows for sending messages.
		
		When a user sends a message through the API, the message is sent to the norm interpreter of the user.
		This interpreter needs to first verify that the message does not violate any of the norms,
		this includes the community norms, the task norms, the sender’s individual norms, as well as the context-dependent
		norms that are attached to this message. If the message violates any of those norms,
		an error message is sent back to the user. However, if the message obeys the norms, then the norm interpreter needs
		to decide what to do next, usually translated into sending messages to other peers. This decision follows from
		the community, individual and context-dependent norms, and takes the user’s profile (both public and private)
		into account as needed. If the message is sent to the interpreter of another user. As in the previous case,
		the norm interpreter of this new user needs to first verify that the message does not violate any of the community norms.
		This re-checking upon receipt ensures that the sender’s norm engine has not been manipulated to cheat.
		If the message violates any of the community norms, then it may either be discarded, or if the community norms
		require sanctioning, then the appropriate sanctions should be executed. However, if the action obeys the community norms,
		then the norm interpreter needs to decide what to do next, which is usually translated into sending messages
		to other peers and/or sending messages to its user. This decision takes into consideration the community norms,
		the context-dependent norms that are attached to the message, the individual private norms of the human whose interpreter
		has received this message, as well as their local profile (both private and public). This ensures that the interpreter
		abides with it is human’s private norms without leaking any of their private norms and profile.
		
		
		## Norm
		
		The functionality provided allows to publish norms, and manage the user and community norms.
		
		There are norms on the individual (user level), the task level, and the community level.
		An individual’s norm might be “Suppress incoming messages at night” (and this will
		be applied for the user who sets this norm only). A task norm might be “Don’t ask my ex”
		(so that would be applied for a specific task only). A community norm might be
		“If you don’t volunteer, you cannot ask for help” and it would be enforced on everyone.
		Given the above, this means that norms will be attached to users, tasks and communities.
		
		
		## Task
		
		The functionality provided allows to publish task types, create and manage task instances.
		
		There are two concepts associated with the notion of a task: type and instance.
		A task type describes a generic goal and the norms that will regulate the interactions
		of the members of any team set to achieve any instance of the task's generic goal.
		An instance of a task type has a specific goal, a team organized around that goal, and
		possibly a set of specific norms that extend the task type's generic norms.
		
		
		## Team
		
		The functionality provided allows to automatically form teams that have diversity in gender,
		personality and intelligence.
		Also, we provide the functions to evaluate the personality and intelligences of users and
		the result can be kept of the profile attributes.
