  title: WeNet - Task manager API
  description: "The task manager component is the one responsible for storing and\
    \ maintaining the task and task types. The task types define the interaction protocols\
    \ between users and the task is an instance of this type.\nThe task type uses\
    \ the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) to define the possible attributes\
    \ of a task, the actions or transactions that a user can do in a task, and the\
    \ messages or callbacks that can be posted to the application from the task execution.\
    \ Also, it has a set of norms that describe the behaviour of the user on the task\
    \ execution.\nWhen a set of users want to be coordinated to do something one of\
    \ them create a new task. This task has associated a type that describes the behaviour\
    \ of the user on this execution. The creator of the task, if wants, can define\
    \ new norms that can modify this default behaviour. The task manager is also responsible\
    \ for maintaining the state of this task execution. For this reason on the task\
    \ model are stored all the transactions that have been done on it, and on this\
    \ transaction are stored the messages that has been sent to the application when\
    \ this transaction is executed. As well, it provides services that can be used\
    \ to obtain the messages sent to the users by the application callbacks."
